Steps to install:

1) Download and install the LTS release of Node.js from nodejs.org, right on the welcome page. 
   Choose to intall the suppplementary tools (default).


2) Download and install MongoDB. https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community. Choose to 
   install it as a service (default).

3) Start MongoDB Compass, hit the big green Connect button which will connect you to the
   just installled service and enter:
	Database name: thiTime
	Collection: gamemastermodels
   You can close Compass, or leave it open if you want to poke around in the data as you 
   run the app

4) Create a folder in your harddrive to install the code into. I will be using the example of 
   C:/Projects/thiTime for the rest of this doc.

5) Go to github.com/SmaugsLair/thiTime. Hit the green Code button and download the zip 
   (or clone if you know git)

6) Extract the contents into C:/Projects. Assuming standard unzipping you will have a new
   directory called C:/Projects:/thiTime-main

7) Open up a command prompt and navigate to this new folder:
   cd \Projects\thiTime-main

8) Run these two commands on the command prompt:
   node defaultSetup.js mongodb://127.0.0.1/thiTime
   node gmSetup.js mongodb://127.0.0.1/thiTime
   This will populate the database with a couple of gms and the default action times.

9) on the command line run this:
   npm start
   
   Leave this running, then open your browser to localhost:3000. 
   Click on GM login, enter deadandy, no password required right now.
   Start creating!
